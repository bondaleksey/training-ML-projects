My training-ML-projects 
=======================

Here you can find my Machine Learning projects which are implemented from January 2022 to June 2022.

- **anomaly-detection**: search for anomalies by methods "Distance-based", "Density-based", "OneClassSVM", "Isolation Forest",
- **clustering**: comparison of the clustering methods "Kmean", "DBSCAN", "Hierarhical",
- **compare_GB_models**: comparison of the boosting methods "Xgboost", "Catboost", "LightGBM",
- **disease-transmission-modeling**: modeling the spread of disease by airlines and their schedules, some simple analysis by graphs tools (networkx),
- **reco-system**: build recommendation system by "User-Item based model" and "Item-User based model",
- **simple-nlp**: web-scraping and year prediction by tf-idf representation of the paper abstracts,
- **time-series-traffic-volume**: forecasting traffic volume.

These projects are part of the Otus MLpro course. 

## Used tools
numpy, pandas, sklearn, xgboost, lightgbm, catboost
